# Demystifying LLMs

let's explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) work

### Next Word Prediction Game

Let's play a quick game! I'll start a sentence, and you try to guess the next word.

_Example:_

> Chris cook goes to the \_\_\_

# How Do LLMs Work?

- LLMs predict the next word in a sequence, just like our game
- Trained on massive datasets
- Use neural networks (transformers)
- Can generate, summarize, translate, and answer questions based on pre-trained data

# Building Enterprise Apps with LLMs

LLMs are trained only up to certain cut-off dates and obviously not all our private data

- Create own model with private data
- Use public model + but have data in private store

# Vector Databases

A vector database is a specialized type of database that plays an essential role in AI applications.

In vector databases, queries differ from traditional relational databases. Instead of exact matches, they perform similarity searches. When given a vector as a query, a vector database returns vectors that are ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to the query vector.

# MCP

The Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is a simple standard, designed and open sourced by Anthropic to help AI tools talk to the systems where data lives. Think of it like a USB-C port, but for AI applications.
